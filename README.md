# Foster Care Analysis

## Background

This project is particularly close to my heart. In August of 2023, I became a CASA (Court Appointed Special Advocate) volunteer. I was assigned to a case with a 4 year old, smart, playful, and loving little boy. I have been able to support him and his family towards reunificaiton and have seen the foster care system from the inside.

Since then, my mom, with my support, has taken in a baby boy who was born with drugs in his system and a mother who was not able to care for him.

Between these two experiences, I have learned more than I ever thought I would in under a year. With this project, I hope to dive deeper into the hope that the foster care system as a whole is supporting children and families in their time of need.
